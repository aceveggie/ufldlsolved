## This contains source code of a basic implmentation of a Convolutional Neural Network (1 layer of convolution followed by pooling, passed to a softmax layer for classification)


## dataset used is STL dataset (object recognition)
### usingfeatures learned in STL exercise (STL10Features.mat)
### convolution is performed.
### the data is then pooled
### and passed to a softmax classifier (4 classes of data)
